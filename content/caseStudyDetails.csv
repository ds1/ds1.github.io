1,AI Co-Development,Building schmitz.ai with Claude,/images/ai-collab-thumbnail.jpg,October 2023,UX Designer & AI Prompt Engineer,Personal Project,Building a Modern Portfolio with AI,Technical Challenge,Traditional content management systems either require backend infrastructure or sacrifice content manageability for static hosting. **The challenge:** Create a static site with dynamic content management capabilities.,Technical Approach,"The solution emerged through iterative AI collaboration, focusing on three key technical areas:\n\n**1. Content Management**\n*Problem:* Need easy content editing without a database\n*Solution:* CSV-based content system with rich text support\n\n**2. Image Handling**\n*Problem:* Complex image path management across development and production\n*Solution:* Automated path resolution system\n\n**3. Build Process**\n*Problem:* Converting content for static hosting\n*Solution:* Automated build pipeline",Implementation Details,Created CSV templates for structured content management;Developed custom CSV to JSON converter with rich text parsing;Implemented automated image path resolution;Built React components with error handling;Established deterministic build process for GitHub Pages,Key Technical Features,**1. Content Management System**\n• CSV files for easy content editing\n• Rich text formatting support\n• Structured content validation\n• Automated JSON conversion\n\n**2. Image Management**\n• Automatic path resolution\n• Development/production path handling\n• Robust error checking\n• Fallback handling\n\n**3. Build Pipeline**\n• CSV validation\n• JSON generation\n• Image path mapping\n• Static file optimization,Content Architecture,"The system uses a **three-tier content architecture**:\n\n1. *Content Layer (CSV)*\n<span class=text-primary"">• Human-editable spreadsheets\n• Rich text formatting\n• Image path references\n• Content validation</span>\n\n2. *Processing Layer (Node.js)*\n<span class=""text-secondary"">• CSV parsing\n• JSON generation\n• Path resolution\n• Error checking</span>\n\n3. *Presentation Layer (React)*\n<span class=""text-success"">• Component rendering\n• Image loading\n• Error handling\n• Performance optimization</span>""",Image System Deep-Dive,The image management system solves several key challenges:\n\n**Path Resolution**\n```javascript\n// CSV Reference\n/images/example.jpg\n\n// Development Import\n../images/example.jpg\n\n// Production Output\n/static/media/example.[hash].jpg\n```\n\n**Key Innovations:**\n• *Automatic path conversion*\n• *Development/production consistency*\n• *Webpack integration*\n• *Error recovery*,Technical Challenges,"Several challenges emerged during development:\n\n1. **Path Resolution**\n<span class=text-warning"">Initial attempts failed to handle image paths consistently between development and production environments.</span>\n\n2. **Rich Text Parsing**\n<span class=""text-warning"">Early versions struggled with nested formatting and special characters in CSV files.</span>\n\n3. **Build Process**\n<span class=""text-warning"">Needed to ensure deterministic builds for GitHub Pages deployment.</span>\n\nEach challenge was solved through iterative AI collaboration","resulting in robust solutions that handle edge cases and provide clear error messages.""",Technology Stack & Results,"Successfully implemented comprehensive system;Reduced content update time by 80%;Eliminated manual image path management;Achieved 100% static hosting compatibility;Maintained sub-2 second page load times;Created maintainable, documented system",/images/system-architecture.jpg,Technical architecture diagram,Three-tier architecture showing content flow,/images/image-system.jpg,Image system diagram,Path resolution system and build process
