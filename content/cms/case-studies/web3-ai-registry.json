  "problem_statement_h2": "The Challenge of AI Agent Discovery",
  "problem_body": "The rapid proliferation of AI agents and MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers created a critical discovery problem. **How do users find and connect with specialized AI services?** Traditional centralized registries pose risks of censorship, single points of failure, and lack of transparency.\\n\\nI set out to create a decentralized solution that would leverage Web3 domains (.agt) as unique identifiers for AI agents, enabling a trustless, permissionless marketplace for AI services on the Polygon blockchain.",
  "technical_approach_h2": "Technical Solution Architecture",
  "approach_list": "Architected smart contracts for on-chain agent registration;Implemented WebSocket validation for MCP endpoint verification;Built capability-based discovery and search functionality;Created Web3 wallet integration with RainbowKit;Developed real-time blockchain data synchronization;Designed intuitive UI for non-technical users to register agents",
  "architecture_h2": "Decentralized Registry System",
  "architecture_body": "The platform consists of **three core components** working in harmony:\\n\\n1. *Smart Contract Layer*\\n<span class=\"text-primary\">• ERC-721 domain ownership verification\\n• On-chain agent metadata storage\\n• Capability tagging system\\n• Active status tracking</span>\\n\\n2. *Frontend Application*\\n<span class=\"text-secondary\">• Next.js 14 with TypeScript\\n• Real-time blockchain queries\\n• WebSocket connection testing\\n• Search and filter interface</span>\\n\\n3. *MCP Integration*\\n<span class=\"text-success\">• JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol support\\n• WebSocket endpoint validation\\n• Capability standardization\\n• Agent chain linking</span>",
  "innovation_details_h2": "Technical Innovations",
  "innovation_body": "Several key innovations emerged from this project:\\n\\n**1. Domain-Based Registration**\\n• Human-readable .agt domains instead of token IDs\\n• *Innovation:* Reverse lookup system for NFT metadata\\n• *Result:* Intuitive user experience for Web3 newcomers\\n\\n**2. Live Endpoint Validation**\\n• Pre-registration WebSocket testing\\n• *Process:* Automated handshake verification\\n• *Benefit:* Ensures only working agents are registered\\n\\n**3. Composable Agent Chains**\\n• Agents can reference other agents\\n• *Architecture:* Graph-based discovery network\\n• *Impact:* Enable complex AI workflows through composition",
