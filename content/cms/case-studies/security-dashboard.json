Security personnel waste valuable time switching between feeds, missing critical events, and struggling with outdated interfaces that weren't designed for modern construction site needs.\\n\\nThe industry needed a solution that could handle the scale and complexity of multi-site monitoring while remaining simple enough for non-technical staff to operate effectively."
