  "problem_body": "Content creators face a critical bottleneck: **professional voice narration is expensive, time-consuming, and inconsistent.** Hiring voice actors costs hundreds per video, recording yourself requires expensive equipment and editing skills, and maintaining consistent quality across content is nearly impossible.\\n\\nWorking with Claude AI, I developed a sophisticated text-to-speech platform that democratizes access to professional voice narration. The challenge was to wrap Google Cloud's powerful but complex TTS API in an interface so intuitive that non-technical creators could generate broadcast-quality narration in minutes.",
