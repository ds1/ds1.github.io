  "problem_statement_h2": "The Challenge",
  "problem_body": "Security camera installation planning for construction sites traditionally relies on disconnected tools: paper blueprints, rough sketches, and guesswork about camera coverage. **This leads to blind spots, wasted resources, and security vulnerabilities.** \\n\\nSensera Systems needed a professional tool that could:\\n• Accurately overlay PDF site plans on satellite imagery\\n• Calculate precise camera coverage based on specifications\\n• Enable collaborative planning between teams\\n• Generate professional documentation for clients",
  "technical_approach_h2": "Solution Architecture",
  "approach_list": "Interactive map foundation with Leaflet.js for geospatial accuracy;PDF overlay system with transformation controls for blueprint alignment;Drag-and-drop resource placement with real-time visual feedback;Firebase integration for persistence and real-time collaboration;Export system generating professional PDF documentation",
  "architecture_h2": "Technical Implementation",
  "architecture_body": "The platform combines **three sophisticated systems** working in harmony:\\n\\n1. *Map & Overlay Engine*\\n<span class=\"text-primary\">• Multi-layer map with satellite/street/grid views\\n• PDF.js integration for blueprint processing\\n• Transform controls for precise alignment\\n• Scale reference system for accurate measurements</span>\\n\\n2. *Resource Management*\\n<span class=\"text-secondary\">• Camera types with FOV visualization\\n• Zone polygons with vertex editing\\n• Real-time coverage calculations\\n• Collision detection and optimization</span>\\n\\n3. *Collaboration & Export*\\n<span class=\"text-success\">• Firebase Firestore for real-time sync\\n• Share links with access control\\n• Professional PDF export with legends\\n• Version history and rollback</span>",
  "innovation_details_h2": "Key Innovations",
  "innovation_body": "**1. PDF Overlay Transformation**\\nDeveloped a unique system for aligning blueprints with satellite imagery:\\n• *Drag & drop positioning* with pixel-perfect accuracy\\n• *Scale reference tool* matching real-world measurements\\n• *Opacity controls* for seamless blending\\n• *Rotation handles* for angular alignment\\n\\n**2. Camera Coverage Visualization**\\nCreated dynamic field-of-view rendering that updates in real-time:\\n• *Distance rings* showing detection ranges\\n• *Angular FOV arcs* based on camera specifications\\n• *Color-coded overlays* for multiple camera types\\n• *Intersection analysis* identifying redundant coverage\\n\\n**3. Polygon Zone Editor**\\nBuilt a professional-grade polygon editing system:\\n• *Vertex manipulation* with drag handles\\n• *Midpoint insertion* for adding vertices\\n• *Batch operations* for multiple zones\\n• *Perimeter vs filled zones* with transparency controls",
