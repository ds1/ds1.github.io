The .si extension offers perfect dual meaning - both a legitimate country code and an abbreviation for superintelligence.\\n\\nI recognized that no centralized marketplace existed for discovering, valuing, and trading premium .si domains specifically positioned for the AI industry. This gap represented both a technical challenge and a business opportunity."
