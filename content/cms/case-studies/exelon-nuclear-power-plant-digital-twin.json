      "content": "Nuclear engineers and managers are under pressure to make critical decisions when their power plant is operating with suboptimal conditions. Delays in this decision-making process have damaging effects. Because the data that inform these pressured decisions are often buried in reports, spreadsheets or isolated dashboards, it is time-consuming to digest and difficult to comprehend.\n\nTo solve this, I designed a digital replica of the plant that workers can monitor from anywhere. The solution exposes the plant’s hidden data and displays them in a way that alleviates stress and enables predictive maintenance. It was described as a 3D command center for these managers.\n\nWe moved from inception to functional prototype in 4 weeks with a team of four. My work included the storyboard, layout, Unity prototype, and visual design."
