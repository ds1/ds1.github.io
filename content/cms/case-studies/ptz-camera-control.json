When theft, vandalism, or safety incidents occur, every second counts - yet operators waste precious time fighting with clunky controls.\\n\\nSecurity personnel monitoring construction sites face a perfect storm of challenges: **multiple camera feeds across sprawling sites, the need for precise camera positioning to investigate incidents, and legacy interfaces designed by engineers rather than users.** Night shift operators particularly struggle with complex controls during critical moments when fatigue compounds usability issues.\\n\\nThe existing PTZ control software used by most construction security companies requires desktop installation, uses hypersensitive slider controls that make precise adjustments nearly impossible, and spreads controls across multiple panels that obscure the video feed."
