The Meeting Paradox**\\n• 71% of senior managers view meetings as unproductive\\n• *Cost:* $37 billion lost annually to unproductive meetings\\n• *Reality:* Key stakeholders often can't attend critical sessions\\n\\n**2. The Email Black Hole**\\n• Average executive receives 126 emails daily\\n• *Problem:* Critical feedback buried in threads\\n• *Result:* 28% of decisions made without full stakeholder input\\n\\n**3. The Synthesis Bottleneck**\\n• Manual synthesis takes 2-3 weeks per initiative\\n• *Impact:* Market opportunities missed\\n• *Consequence:* Competitors move faster with inferior data\\n\\nI identified an opportunity to transform this chaos into structured intelligence using AI synthesis combined with asynchronous stakeholder collection.",
